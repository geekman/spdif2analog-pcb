SPDIF Optical to Analog Converter
==================================

This is a device that converts uncompressed PCM audio stream from an OPTICAL
OUT connection into analog audio that can be connected to a LINE IN of some
device.
It does NOT support decoding 5.1 audio streams.

Files
------

The hardware design files are in the *CadSoft EAGLE* format, 
now known as [Autodesk EAGLE](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview).
You can download and use EAGLE for free to open the files, view the schematics 
and generate Gerber files for manufacture.

For convenience, generated files _may_ have been made available under the 
**Releases** or **Downloads** section of the repository, but otherwise, 
you have to do it yourself.


Some footprints used in the design may have come from the 
[SparkFun EAGLE libraries](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries).
